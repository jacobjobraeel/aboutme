    <h1>Background</h1>
    <br>
    I am a Middle Eastern student growing up in Michigan near the city of Detroit.
    My family is from a Chatholic village in Iraq, and immagrated to the United States after religious violence directed toward us. 
    I am the first person in my family to attend high school and hopefully college! Growing up, I would always trouble my teachers with many questions to the point that I was even limited in the number I could ask per class.
    I believe my curiousity is one of my strong suits as well as being out-going and supportive of those around me. My passions include computer science (hence the website), medicine, and physics!

    <h1>School</h1><br> I attend Gene L. Klida Utica Academy For International Studies.
     It's wonderful highschool with amazing teachers. 
     I am in the IB program, which is kind of like AP courses, but the credits are applicable around the world. I am writing my mandatory paper in math about elliptic curve cryptography or ECC for short.

    <h1>Hobbies/Extracurriculars</h1>
    Soccer - I grew up playing the sport since I was little and am extremely competitive about it. My favorite player currently is Mbapp√©.
    Coding - I got into coding when my district provided computers for the students. Having access to a computer, I became curious on how the technology worked, and I eventually started to teach myself how to code.
    Cooking - Eating is probably my favorite thing to do EVER. However, the food needs to be made before-hand. Currently, my mother is teaching me how to cook some of our traditional dishes for me to be able to make and eat the amazing meals when I go off to college.
    Lifting - Being a super skinny and awkward kid growing up made me an easy target to be picked on and bullied. I have always hated fighting and confrontation, I went to the gym to get strong enough to protect myself and those around me from experiencing what I did as a child. I also do it to look good :).
